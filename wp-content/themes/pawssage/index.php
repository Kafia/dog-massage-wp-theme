            <h2>What is Canine massage</h2>
              <p>Canine massage is based on the same principles of human massage. It is a therapeutic modality that can help relieve stress, relieve muscle tension, increase blood flow, and maintain the overall health of a dog. Massage is not a cure but a complementary treatment to be used in conjunction with regular veterinary care, chiropractic, acupuncture, proper conditioning, and nutrition.</p>

                       <h2>Who benefits?</h2>
                         <p>All dogs can benefit from canine massage. Massage can help socialize 
puppies and dogs that are not used to human touch. Older dogs benefit in a multitude of ways that can minimize the use of pain medication dependent on the conditions. The stress placed on the joints of overweight and dogs with bad structure can be minimized with a regime of massage, proper exercise, and veterinary care. Performance dogs train and compete in a way that has them engaging in repetitive movements that can create chronic problems due to the stress placed on their joints, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Believe it or not, as you will see in Lotusâ€™s case, active dogs that play hard with other dogs can develop soft tissue and joint problems that warrant both massage and chiropractic care.</p>
